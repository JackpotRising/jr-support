# Account Questions

## How do I create an account and compete?

There are multiple ways to create a Jackpot Rising account:

- Create an account through [PlayerHQ](https://playerhq.jackpotrising.com)
- Download one of our [games](https://www.jackpotrising.com/games) and create an account
- Download our native app and sign up with our seemless onboarding *(coming soon)*

## Why do I have to provide any personal information?

We hate when sites randomly ask for all of your information, as much as you do. That is why we make sure to only ask for information when it is absolutely necessary and only the minimum amount of information that we need. Below are the three main times we ask for personal informations:

#### 1. Registration
We allow you to create a guest account without providing any personal information so you can try out tournaments. However, to be able to save your progress and log back into your account, we require an email address and password to ensure that only you can get into your account.

#### 2. Deposits
You can use our entire platform without ever having to deposit! But if you decide to turn up the level of competition by deposting, then we are required by law to ask for your birthdate to verify your age. This is to ensure that you are using your credit card.

#### 3. Withdrawals
Congratulations! If you made it to this step, then you have won some money and you are wanting to pocket your hard earn winnings. Unfortunately, regulations for tracking withdrawals from an online platform are very strict. That is why we may require you to further verify your account with additional information.

**Why do we need this?**

We take compliance and safety very seriously, thus we implement extra measures to verify each user’s identity. **However, we are constantly evaluating what information we ask for and removing anything that is not essential to remain compliant.**

> We adhere to the Know Your Customer (“KYC”) policies required by the USA Patriot Act, which requires us to collect specific information from users to maintain security. These measures also help reduce operational liability for the banks and processors, who help us securely and properly handle your funds, on a variety of levels. Any of your information provided is encrypted and used for verification and compliance purposes.

## How do I reset my password?

If you forgot your password, then you can visit [PlayerHQ](https://playerhq.jackpotrising.com) and select "Forgot Password" to receive an email to reset your password.

!> You must have a registered account to reset your password. Guest accounts, which are not tied to an email address, cannot reset login information. Please be sure to register your guest account with an email and password to avoid losing the account!

## How do I change my account information?

To change any of you account information, please vist the Account section of [PlayerHQ](https://playerhq.jackpotrising.com) where you can change things like username, email, password, etc.
