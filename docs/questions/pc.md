# PC App Questions

## How do I compete in Jackpot Rising's PC tournaments?
To compete in Jackpot Rising's PC tournaments you need to complete the following steps:

1. Download the Overwolf client and inistall our [app](https://overwolf.jackpotrising.com)
2. Create a Jackpot Rising account or Register a new one
3. Enter a tournament and begin competing

## Who is Overwolf?
Overwolf is an overlay platform that allows us to capture and process real-time game events for tournaments. They have done a lot of heavy lifting to make their platform as developer friendly as possible, which allows us to focus on adding new games and providing the best tournament experience possible.

## I won but I do not see my winnings in my account?
When tournaments end there is a built in delay period that allows us to review the results before the winnings are moved into your account from escrow. This is done to minimize technical errors and/or cheating by any players.

## Why has my withdrawal request still not been processed?
Withdrawal requests are still in the process of being automated, but there are a lot of factors that go into processing a request (i.e. identity verrification, account checks, system checks, transaction logging, etc.). Because of all these steps it takes time to process all of your requests. We appreciate you being patient with us as we look to speed up this process through automation.

## How many tournaments can I enter and compete in at the same time?
Currently, you can enter into as many tournaments as you'd like and your score will count for all the tournaments that your current attempt can apply to.


# Troubleshooting

## Why is Overwolf not detecting that my game is open?
There are a few things that can cause this to happen. Below are some of the common causes and how to resolve them:

- **You launched Overwolf after the game** - Overwolf needs to be launched before the game is launched to ensure that it can properly detect the game. Simply close out of Overwolf and the game and then relaunch Overwolf first, followed by any supported game. 
- **You have the game disabled or the Jackpot Rising app disabled on Overwolf** - In Overwolf you are able to toggle individual games on and off. You are also able to toggle individual apps on and off for each game. Please check in your Overwolf settings to make sure that both the game and Jackpot Rising are enabled. *Please note that any game installed after you install Overwolf will be disabled by default.*
- **You are playing an unsupported game** - Please check and make sure that the game you have running in the background is currently supported by Jackpot Rising. If it is not supported, then please reach out and let us know as we are always looking to add games to our platform.

## Why are my attempts not counting towards my tournament score/rank?
- **You are out of attempts or not entered in the tournament** - Please check to make sure that you are entered into the tournament. If you are, then also check that you have attempts left and have not hit any cap for the tournament.
- **You are competing in the wrong game mode** - Please check and make sure that your game matches all of the parameters in the tournament. i.e. You are competing in King Of The Hill on Social mode instead of Team Death Match in Competitvie mode.
